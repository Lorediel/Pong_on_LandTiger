# Pong

The famous pong game implemented for the LandTiger baseboard in C. This is an individual project done for a university course. <br>
To start the application on keil microvision, move the file sample.uvprojx into the files directory and start it. To use it you need either a LandTiger Emulator or a physical landtiger board to load the program into.

Note: On the emulator the paddle seems to glitch, but the problem is not present on the physical board!
